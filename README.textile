Sinatra app originally written in 30 seconds to choose attendee names at
"acts_as_conference":http://actsasconference 2009 for prize giveaways, but for
some reason I kept tweaking it...

    sudo gem install sinatra
    echo "Name One\nName two" > names.txt
    ruby namepicker.rb
    open http://localhost:4567
