Sinatra app originally written in 30 seconds to choose random names from a
list of "acts_as_conference":http://actsasconference.com 2009 attendees for
prize giveaways, but for some reason I kept growing and tweaking it...

    sudo gem install sinatra
    cp data/names.txt.example data/names.txt
    cp data/zingers.txt.example data/zingers.txt
    ruby namepicker.rb
    open http://localhost:4567
