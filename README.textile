Sinatra app originally written in 30 seconds to choose attendee names at
"acts_as_conference":http://actsasconference 2009 for prize giveaways, but for
some reason I kept growing and tweaking it...

    sudo gem install sinatra
    cp data/names.txt.example data/names.txt
    cp data/zingers.txt.example data/zingers.txt
    ruby namepicker.rb
    open http://localhost:4567
